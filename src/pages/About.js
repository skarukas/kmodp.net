          Stephen Karukas is a recent graduate of the Indiana University Jacobs School
          of Music, where he received degrees in music composition and percussion
          performance, with additional studies in computer music, computer science,
          and jazz studies. He has studied drumset with Steve Houghton, percussion
          with Kevin Bobo, John Tafoya, and Joseph Gramley, and composition with
          Claude Baker, P.Q. Phan, and Don Freund. He also attended Interlochen
          Arts Academy as a student of John Alfieri. He has been a performance
          fellow at nief-norf and a student in electronic music programming at
          IRCAM (Paris, France).
        </p>
        <p>
          With work ranging in style from ambient and meditative
          to impressionistic to excitingly rhythmic, Karukas has composed music for
          ensembles such as Fifth House Ensemble, the Indiana University Percussion
          Ensemble, and California-based ensemble Definiens. He has also produced solo
          and duo works through collaborations with Daniel Myers (Elements for multiple
          percussion solo), the Hutchens/Myers Duo (It flows for saxophone and marimba),
          Rose Lipham (Bad Number for solo timpani and To Live and Die in the Wild for
          multiple percussion solo), and Paul Millette (blue-gray for solo marimba).
          Recently, blue-gray received the Honorable Mention in the 2019 PASIC Composition
          Contest. Other honors include Honorable Mention in the 2018 SCI/ASCAP Student
          Commission Competition and selection in multiple calls for scores by various
          ensembles in the United States and abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          His music has been performed at universities around the United States and at
          events such as RED NOTE Music Festival, the Midwest Composers Symposium,
          Frontwave New Music, and the Navy Band Saxophone Symposium. Recent highlights
          include a performance of his orchestral work In a Breath, Ending by the Indiana
          University Concert Orchestra and a performance of Elements for multiple
          percussion solo by percussionist Cameron Leach at the TUTTI Festival at
          Denison University.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to composition, Karukas is a percussionist, having performed as an
          orchestral percussionist with the Terre Haute Symphony Orchestra, Columbus Indiana
          Philharmonic, and the Carmel Symphony Orchestra in Indiana. As a member of Indiana
          University's top ensemble the Philharmonic Orchestra, he performed under the baton
          of artists such as Carl St. Clair (Pacific Symphony), Franz Welser-MÃ¶st
          (Cleveland Orchestra), Giancarlo Guerrero (Nashville Symphony), Federico Cortese
          (Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra), and Marzio Conti (Oviedo Filarmonia).
        </p>
        <p>
          Karukas performed at PASIC 2018 as a member of the Indiana University Percussion
          Ensemble, premiering new works by Brian Blume and Kevin Bobo as one of three undergraduates
          in the ensemble. He has also performed as a drummer in jazz combos at Indiana
          University, as well as in the IU Opera Theatre's production of The Music Man and
          IU Theatre's production Stardust Road featuring the music of Hoagy Carmichael.

          I did my masters at IU focusing on artificial intelligence, and I

      <div className="about-section-content">
        <p>
          I love microtonal music, and a lot of the tools I've developed are motivated
          by the idea of abstracting harmony past 12-tone equal temperament.
          In a perfect world, that would mean composition as the act of freely
          stacking intervals no matter if they exist on a keyboard or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these tools are <EasyLink to="https://github.com/skarukas/xen">xen</EasyLink>, a programming language and REPL environment
          made for xenharmonic tasks, <EasyLink to="https://github.com/skarukas/tune">tune.js</EasyLink>, an object-oriented Javascript library
          that models notes and intervals abstractly, and an <EasyLink to="https://skarukas.github.io/web-audio-projects/random-harmonics/">
            ambient music generator</EasyLink> that constantly adds consonant frequencies to currently sounding frequencies.
          I donât write any specifically microtonal music, and the reason why is
          because I tried and it was really hard to do so I gave up. My idea was to
          make some tools that make it easier and maybe try again someday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also interested in applying
          graphical models ("networks") to harmonic analysis,
          and they generalize to microtonal music very well. For an application of
          a graph algorithm to adaptive tuning, check out
          <EasyLink to="pdf/adaptive-tuning.pdf"> a short informal paper I wrote </EasyLink>
          which includes some ideas about how a pitch set
          can be modeled as a weighted undirected graph, with the problem of
          adaptive JI being reduced to the generation
          of a minimum-diameter spanning tree, which is equivalent to a connected
          subset of a tuning lattice. In the same vein, I created an experimental
          MIDI editor named <EasyLink to="https://github.com/skarukas/springs" className="hover-anchor">springs</EasyLink> that allows voice-specific tuning annotations, configurable just intonation, and modular microtonal interval structures (trees).
        </p>
        <p>
          I also designed an algorithm and <EasyLink to="https://skarukas.github.io/lattice-search/">
            web app</EasyLink> for finding optimal approximations of equal-tempered
          intervals using combinations of arbitrary basis intervals, which works using
          a <EasyLink to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space" >state graph abstraction </EasyLink>
          and search, an method usually used in AI path-finding algorithms.
